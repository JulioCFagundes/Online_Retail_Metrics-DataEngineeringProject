# Online_Retail_Metrics-DataEngineeringProject

It's an simple but very necessary feature management.
This project aims to create new features and simple visualizations that can help business to understand the customers and make decisions more informed.

With some few informations as products prices and quantity that customers had buyed we created essentials indicators for business management, such as:

  * company renevue per month
  * monthly growing rate (of revenue)
  * monthly active customers
  * products sales per month

This metrics can also helps to make even more sofisticated analysis as RMF or make a client segmentation to help your managers to make more data-informed decisions.

Hope it's usefull!
